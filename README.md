# Background
This is a personal project to showcase SQL skills and also to understand the demands of the dynamic data analysis field as a budding analyst staying up to date with industry trends.

Data was sourced from [Luke Barousse App for Data Nerds](/https://lukebarousse.com/sql)

### The questions I looked to answer with my SQL queries include: 
1. What were the high paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are the most in-demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to have?
# Tools Used For Analysis
I employed the following tools for myanalysis of the data job market
- SQL
- PostgreSQL
Visual Studio Code
- Github
- Git
# Analysis
In this analysis, the point of each query was to investigate specific aspects of the data analyst job market
### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and by job postings that include a yearly salary average. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    name AS company_name,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date::DATE
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Key Insights
- High Salaries for Leadership Roles
- Emerging Demand for Specialized Roles
- Geographic Diversity

### 2. Top Skills Required for Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
I joined the job postings data to the skills data to uncover what employers are looking for in high paying roles. I also filtered by job location focusing on remote roles.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    name AS company_name,
    salary_year_avg
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
)
SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON  top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
```
**Key Insights**

Concentration Around Core Skills:
- Just 5 skills (SQL, Python, Tableau, R, Snowflake) make up 42% of all skill mentions.
- Learning these gives you access to most high-paying opportunities.

INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY 
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC  
LIMIT 5
```

|Skills  | Demand Count|
